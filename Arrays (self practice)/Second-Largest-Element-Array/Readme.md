2. Second Largest Element in an Array (Without Sorting)
Difficulty: Easy

Problem Statement
You are given an array arr of N distinct integers. Your task is to find the second largest element in the array without using any sorting algorithms. If no second largest element exists (e.g., if the array has fewer than two elements), print -1.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains N, the size of the array.

The second line contains N space-separated distinct integers.

Output Format
For each test case, print the second largest element. If it doesn't exist, print -1.
